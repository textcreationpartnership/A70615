            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <p>And the said Jurors do further say, upon their Oaths, That the said Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement, Lands, and Premisses, with the Appurtenances that were the said <hi>J.

B.</hi> as appears by divers Deeds unto the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors aforesaid, in evidence therein, at the time of the taking of this <hi>Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sition,</hi> and that upon view of the said evidences, it appeared that divers Feoffments have been made of the said Premisses by surviving Feoffees, to their Children, and others of their alliance, by which means, the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the said Premisses hath been continued in the name and bloud of several Families, that have lived in the said Parishes, and that thereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Knights, Esquires, and Gentlemen of worth and quality have been left out, that have been then Inhabitants of the said Parishes. And the Jury aforesaid do further say, upon their Oaths, that the said Tenement, Lands, and Premisses, with the Appurtenances, are now by mean Convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and Assurance, come unto <hi>J. S.</hi> of <hi>E.</hi> aforesaid, Gent. <hi>W. C.</hi> of <hi>T. G.</hi> aforesaid, Gent. <hi>A. S.</hi> of <hi>E.</hi> aforesaid, Gent. and to divers others, being in all, about 18 in number; and that the said <hi>J. S.</hi> and <hi>A. S.</hi> and their An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cestors, have been Feoffees of the said Premisses, ever since the year of our Lord God, 1611. and that they, and the other Feoffees now living, claim no interest in the said Premisses, but as Feoffees in Trust for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the Will of the said <hi>J. B.</hi> and the said <hi>J. S. W. C. A. S.</hi> and divers others of the now Feoffees, appearing before the said Commissi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, and the said Jurors, at the time and place first above-mentioned, and did then and there produce two Books that have been kept by them and others, under whom they claim, wherein are set down the Accounts of the yearly Revenues and Profits that have been made of the said Premis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, from the year of our Lord God 1587. and divers years before, until this present. And upon our view of the said Books it appeareth, that the Trust of the said Will hath been managed by some few of the 24 Feoffees,
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:63482:13"/> the residue giving an implicite Consent to what such few should do, both concerning the bestowing of the yearly Revenue of the said Premisses, and of the said Woodsales; as also in election of Rent-gatherers, and in making up an allowance of the yearly accounts. And it did also further appear by view of the said Books, that the yearly accompts therein set down, are imperfect, and that there are many alterations in the figures of the sums of Money, expended by the said Rent-gatherers, and that the Accompts therein specified, are for the most part, made by disburse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of sums of Money in the general, with reference unto particular Bills, not set down in the said Books, and that at one time, or in two, or three years together, no Accompts were made by the Rent-gatherers: and that the said Feoffees have failed to elect, yearly, new Rent-gatherers: And that they have allowed unto the Tenant of the said House and Lands, out of his Rent, sometimes 40 s. for a Dinner, at their meeting; and that the said Feoffees and Rent-gatherers, have from time to time, kept Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys in their hands, which they have received for Rent of the said House and Lands, which they call in their Books of Accompts, House-money; and divers sums of Money which they have received by sale of the Wood in <hi>R. W.</hi> which they call Church-Money; and that sometimes they have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended the House-money upon the Church; and sometimes the Church-money upon the High-ways; and have entred their Accounts, as Money borrowed of the Church, for the House; and of the House for the Church; and they have brought into Accompt divers sums of Money, to have been expended by them yearly, upon the said Churches of <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>T.

And the said Jurors, do further say, upon their Oaths, That sithence the year, 1611. until this present, divers Feoffees, some whereof are yet living, have been at several times Rent-gatherers and Feoffees; And that for the most part of that time, the yearly Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue and Rent of the said House and Lands, have been about 20 <hi>l.</hi> which according to their accompts, have been expended yearly in repair of the High-ways, between <hi>M.</hi> and some 3 or 4 miles of <hi>E.</hi> and for their Dinner at their meetings, and by giving of 40 <hi>s.</hi> or more, in some years, to seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral poor persons, inhabiting in the said Parishes; And that in that time, Woodsales have been made of the Woods growing in <hi>R.</hi> Grove; and that the Moneys thereupon arising, have been kept in their hands these three years, and they have new built the said House called <hi>S.</hi> and improved the said Tenement and Lands to be worth 26 <hi>l.</hi> 13 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d. per annum</hi> to be Letten: And further, the said Jurors do say upon their Oaths, that the yearly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penses of the said Feoffees, have been (by Auditors appointed by the said Commissioners, in the presence of some of the said Feoffees) cast, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:63482:13"/> and by the said Auditors Certificate it appears, that over and above all Charges and Expenses by the said Feoffees, until this present time, in building the said House, repair of the High-ways, Gifts of Money to poor People, Moneys expended in Dinners, and repair of the said Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, there doth at this time remain in the hands of <hi>J.

And the said Jurors do further say, upon their Oaths, that sometimes the surviving Feoffees have suffered the interest of the said Premisses, to continue in them, until under the number of eight Feoffees were surviving, and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the said Parishes. And that the said last Feoffment, made of the said Premisses, by the then surviving Feoffees, divers of the said last Feoffees are since dead; so that at this present, they are but to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of 19 Feoffees, living, and inhabiting within the said Parishes of <hi>E.</hi> and <hi>T.

And lastly, for that the Commission, directed to the Commissioners in the said Decree named, wherein they made the said Decree, was not returned into this Court, at the time of the said Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, unto which Exceptions, these Respondents saving unto themselves, all advantages of Exception, to the incertainties and insufficiencies thereof, say, That they are upon the matter, strangers to the matters, set forth by the said Exceptions, having not lived very long in the Parish, and being no otherwise concerned, then as Churchwardens thereof; and it cannot be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, they should know the Facts and Titles alledged by the said Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their own knowledge. But they say, that the said Exceptant was se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral times summoned and heard before the Commissioners that made the said Decree, and the Jury by them impannelled; And he brought his Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Counsel with him, who urged before the said Jury and Commissioners, who were Learned in the Law, and good and honest Men, before their Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict given, or Decree made, the substance and matter of the said Excepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and whatever could be alledged against the Decreeing of the Premisses, and the same Decree was made upon a full hearing of both sides. And one of the main points insisted on before the said Jury and Commissioners, was the matter of the aforesaid first two Exceptions, whether the Premisses de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creed to be charged with the <hi>Charitable Use,</hi> were the Messuage, Tenement, and Lands given by the said Will, yea or no, it being a proper issue for a Jury of parcel, or no parcel, the same Premisses in the occupation of the Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, were after a full and deliberate hearing and evidence on both sides, found by the said Jury to be the same Tenements and Lands, devised by the said Will. And the matter of the said two next Exceptions, Whether the said Exceptants Grandfather had notice of the <hi>Charitable Ʋse</hi> before, or at his Purchase of the Premisses, or that the Premisses were in the <hi>Crown,</hi> yea, or no, being also proper for a Jury, were likewise upon the like Evidence then given, found by the said Jury for the said Parish, against the Exceptant. And these Respondents verily believe, the said Exceptant cannot but be satisfied with the said Verdict and Decree, and doth trouble these Respon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents and the said Parish, onely to drive them to some composition, or low terms of agreement: And in particular, these Respondents say, That they doubt not to make it appear by several particulars, and parcels of Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences and Pleadings, and Proofs in several Courts, (if this Honourable Court should now think fit to put them thereunto, after the said Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Verdict) that the Premisses charged with the said <hi>Charitable Use,</hi> are the same that were charged and devised by the said Will, and that the Purchasor (if he was one) had, and could not but have, and take notice before, and at the time of his Purchase: And likewise say, That the said King <hi>Edward</hi> the VI. or his Father, <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. Queeen <hi>Mary,</hi> or Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> or either of them, were not at any time seized, or intituled to be seized of the Premisses, or any part thereof; and if the said King <hi>Edw.</hi> the VI. made such Grant as aforesaid, the same was not of these self-same Premisses, but of other Tenements; and if it were, the said King had no Seisin, or Inheritance of, or in the said Lands, or right, so to grant the same, nor doth the said Grant, if any such be, prejudice the <hi>Charitable Ʋse,</hi> as
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:63482:24"/> the Respondents are advised. And these Respondents further say, That they are informed, the said Commission is returned into this Court, and there remain of Record: Wherefore these Respondents humbly pray the said Decree may stand ratified and confirmed, and the said Decree and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Ʋse</hi> may be performed, and these Respondents discharged with their Costs in this behalf, most wrongfully sustained.</p>

(2) That <hi>John Meeke</hi> made no such Will, but dyed <hi>intestate,</hi> and the Lands descended to the Exceptant. (3) That no Evidence was given to the Jurors, but Depositions taken in the Prerogative Court, which was no Evidence at Law or Equity. (4) That the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors did not find that <hi>John Meeke</hi> dyed seized in Fee, and so no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing could pass by the pretended Will. (5) That the Decree was grounded upon a void and insignificant Inquisition. (6) That the Commissioners have determined a Right, and set up an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>state in a Corporation, no way at all concerned, mentioned, or intended by <hi>John Meeke</hi> in the pretended Will, <hi>viz.</hi> The Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and they to stand seized to the use of a Hall, being no Corporation, or body Politique, capable in Law or Equity, to

(3) That it was proved to the Jurors, that <hi>John Meeke</hi> made such a Will in Writing, as in the Inquisition is mentioned; and that <hi>John Meeke,</hi> a little before his death, declared, That he had not altered, nor would alter that Will. (4) And that <hi>Jonathan Magwick</hi> did imbezle the Will; and the Exceptant did say, That his Uncle did tell him, that he had made his Will, and had gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven his Land to <hi>Magdalen Hall,</hi> for the maintainance of poor Scho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and had promised to settle the Lands accordingly; and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers other answers were given to the Exceptions.

                     <p>The Lord <hi>Elsmore,</hi> and the Judges declared, that there had been an apparent breach of Trust, and that the Hospital had been abused, by being kept from what by the Donor was meant unto them, <hi>viz.</hi> the Land it self, and not only a dry Rent, being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the Donor, for the good and benefit of the Hospital.

The substance of the Matter, upon which the said Decree is grounded, being, That one <hi>Mary Chambers,</hi> by her last Will in Writing, 7 <hi>June</hi> 1654. did devise unto the Churchwardens, and Overseers for the Poor of the Parish of <hi>St. Gilis</hi> without <hi>Cripplegate, London,</hi> the sum of 100 l. to be paid to them, for the increase of their Parish Store, which said 100 l. was accordingly paid unto the then Churchwardens of that part of the said Parish, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within <hi>London,</hi> for the use of the Poor aforesaid, and the said Money was by them placed out at interest, for the use aforesaid: And that the said Exceptants, being Churchwardens of that part of the said Parish, which lyeth within <hi>London;</hi> did, on, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the first of <hi>July,</hi> 15 <hi>Car. nunc Regis,</hi> receive 3 l. for Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest of the said 100 l. and disposed thereof to the Poor of that part of the said Parish, which is in <hi>London,</hi> no part thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paid to the Poor of the other part of the said Parish lying in <hi>Middlesex.</hi>

                     <hi>Katherine Banne</hi> grants, by Déed, a Rentseck out of <hi>208</hi> Acres of Land, for relief of the Poor in those Parishes, and limits this to commence after her death, and gives Seisin of this in her life, the Rent is behind for <hi>36</hi> years, <hi>Hide</hi> purchas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the Land, having notice of the <hi>Charitable Use,</hi> and in the Grant there was a <hi>nomine poenae</hi> of <hi>50 s.</hi> if the Rent be not paid by her Heirs within <hi>14</hi> days after it was due by the Grant, and it was found, that <hi>Hide</hi> had held the Land seven years; upon a Commission for <hi>Charitable Uses,</hi> the Commissioners Decreé, that <hi>Hide</hi> shall pay all the Arrearages for <hi>36</hi> years, and also the Arrearages of the <hi>nomine poenae</hi> for <hi>7</hi> years, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the time he had enjoyed the Land,<note place="margin">Power of the Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> and decree that the Grantor shall distrain for the Rent for ever after. And the Commissioners Decreé being returned in <hi>Chancery,</hi> the Lord Kéeper referred it to the Iudges, who resolved these points:</p>
                  <p>
                     <note place="margin">To order pay of Arrears.</note>First, That <hi>Hide</hi> should pay all the Arrearages for <hi>36</hi> years, for that the Land is chargeable with the Rent; in whose hands soever it cometh.</p>

                  <pb n="77" facs="tcp:63482:42"/>
                  <p>Fourthly, If a Rent be granted out of Land to a <hi>Charita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Use,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Notice to be given.</note> and one buys the Land for a valuable consideration of Money, having no notice of the <hi>Charitable Use</hi> and Rent, yet the Rent remains, because it is collateral to the Land, and another thing; and the notice required by the Statute is to be given, as well of the Land, as of the <hi>Charitable Use.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fifthly, Resolved that the Purchasor shall not pay the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rearages of the <hi>nomine poenae,</hi> because it was a personal charge upon the Heir, who ought to have paid the Rent, and it doth not charge the Land.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, when the Heir, or others,<note place="margin">Power of Commission<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</note> charged to pay a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Use,</hi> do break the Trust, the Commissioners may transfer the Trust unto others, as to the Church-wardens,<note place="margin">To transfer a Trust.</note> or other Parishioners of the Parish, where the <hi>Charitable Use</hi> is to be distributed.</p>
                  <p>Lastly it was resolved, That if a Rent-seck be granted to a <hi>Charitable Use,</hi> the Commissioners, by their Decreé, cannot make this a Rent-charge, by adding a clause of Distress, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less it be, for that this alters the nature of the Rent in the creation of it, and is against the mind of the Donor. <hi>Mich. 2.

                  <p>Secondly, the words of the Statute of 43 <hi>Eliz.</hi> are very considerable in, this Case; for although the Statute doth give power to the Lord Chancellor, or Lord Kéeper, upon complaint to them made, to adnull, diminish, alter, or inlarge any De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creé, made by the Commissioners for <hi>Charitable Uses:</hi> yet the same is with this Limitation, so far as may stand with Equity and good Conscience, according to the true intent and meaning of the Donor and Founder thereof.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That if <hi>A.</hi> Devise to any of his kindred, to Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vses; and though he had limited them to pay certain sums of Money to those Vses,<note place="margin">Superstitious Uses.</note> yet are those Lands given to the King: No other consideration shall be supposed, but that which they in those times thought to be the Service of God.

Devise of an Estate for Life, or in Tail, as within the Statute by Equity, though it says, <hi>To have continuance for ever;</hi> The intent of the Statute, was, to extinguish those Vses; it regards not the time of their continuance. 2. Estates Tail may continue for ever; and this was the intent of the Devisor, that the Vses should continue for ever; for here, when it is come to him, is to do as much; without this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction the Statute would be eluded.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Statute wills, That Lands assigned for the find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a Priest, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> belong to the King, then to give Lands on condition to find a Priest, must be within the Statute, as more compulsory than the other.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The whole Land was given to the King, but not by the first Branch; that extends only to lawful Chantreys, or such as have the countenance of a lawful beginning; not to those that want the colour of such lawful beginnings; as where the Popes Licence lays the first Stone. This is a Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try without colour of a lawful Foundation, so where the Gift is to find a Chantry without a Corporation, this is out of that Branch. Now by the second Branch, that gives the Land be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to such Colledges to the King, without which, only the scituation had béen his. By the third Branch, which reaches to the finding a Priest without Corporation. It was said, That the Land was not given to the finding a Priest, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a Pension was appointed him out of it; and the Statute speaks thus, <hi>The King shall have it in large; &amp;c. as the Priest had;</hi> then that a good Vse was limited, 6 <hi>d.</hi> wéekly to six poor Men; and though he added, To pray, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> this is not prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for none but publick Prayers are within the Statute: Answered, with these differences, If 20 <hi>l.</hi> be given yearly to find a Priest, though his share is to be but 10 <hi>l.</hi> by the year, all is given to the King, the rest shall be intended to find ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessaries: Otherwise, if a Condition were fixed to the Gift of 10 <hi>l.</hi> the year, there the King shall not have more then the 10 <hi>l.</hi> Secondly, 20 <hi>l.</hi> the year assigned, 10 <hi>l.</hi> to find a Priest, and the other 10 <hi>l.</hi> to the Poor, the same; were it generally to find, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And for maintainance of poor Men, without limitation what the Priest shall have; the King must have the Land or nothing; Thirdly, 20 <hi>l.</hi> Land, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the sallary of a Priest 10 <hi>l.</hi> some other Necessaries are to be found in certain. A good Vse limited over, the King shall not have more than 10 <hi>l.</hi> a good Vse in certain shall be preserved before a Superstitious Vse in certain; if nothing be limited in certain to the Priest, the King has all; Fourthly, if only a stipend be limited, no more but the stipend: Fifthly, after the sum to the Priest, Vses follow, not forbidden, but depending upon the Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Vses, nothing shall be preserved: Sixthly, So there be what certainty there can be, if they be all Superstitious; the words, <hi>In as large, &amp;c.</hi> They refer to the First, Second, and Fourth Branches, not to the Third, else the King shall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63482:50"/> have the Land it self, which was never limited to the Priest; and though the Prayers were to be made out of the Church, it is within the Statute.

Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit there had béen a sufficient maintainance for the Priest, yet because there were good Vses, separate and divided from the Superstitious Vse, <hi>(viz.)</hi> in the one Case 3 <hi>s.</hi> 4 <hi>d.</hi> for the Poor, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in the other, to find Ornaments in the Church; for these Causes, Iudgement was given, that the Land was not given to the King. Also it was adjudged for these Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons in <hi>Hewets</hi> Case, That the King should not have the Land; (1.) Because the Land it self was not given to find a Priest, (and so not within the third Branch of the Act) but to find an annual Sustentation of 10 Marks for a Priest, which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Fourth, and not the Third Branch. And it was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solved, That in the Case of the Dean of <hi>Pauls</hi> (touched by <hi>Dyer,</hi>) That if Land be given to pay 10 Marks to a Priest, and 40 <hi>s.</hi> to the maintainance of an <hi>Obit;</hi> in this Case, if both be found within the five years, the King will have all the Land. But in that Case, because the <hi>Obit</hi> was not found within the five years, the King could not have the Land. And therein this difference was taken, where certain sums are limited to Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitious Vses, and one Vse is separate and divided from the other; there the finding of one, will not give all the Land to the King, but onely the Sum appointed to the Superstiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Vse, which was imployed within the five years. But if the one Vse depend upon the other, there the finding of the Principal, or any part thereof, giveth all the Land to the King. As where Land is given to the intent, that an <hi>Obit</hi> shall be in such a Church or Chappel, and that upon the <hi>Obit,</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> shall be imployed and distributed to the Priest, and to divers poor persons, who shall be present at it, 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> and the rest of the Profits to the reparation of the Church or Chappel; in this case, if the <hi>Obit</hi> be maintained with any part within the five years, albeit the 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> be not imployed to the poor men, nor any thing upon the reparation of the Church or Chappel, within the five years, yet all the Land will go to the King. So where certain Houses, called the <hi>Bull,</hi> were given to find a Priest to pray for Souls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other Tenements called
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63482:50"/> the <hi>Swan,</hi> were given to the same Feoffeés to find an <hi>Obit</hi> to the same Feoffeés; and the Feoffeés imployed the Profits of the several Houses to contrary Vses, <hi>(viz)</hi> the pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>fits of the <hi>Bull</hi> for the <hi>Obit,</hi> and the profits of the <hi>Swan</hi> for the Priest, by this all is given to the King, <hi>Cook</hi> 4 <hi>Part,</hi> 115. So if one give the Mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> and the Mannor of <hi>Sale,</hi> to find Superstitious Vses, and they with the profits of one Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, find the Superstitious Vses, and imploy the profits of the other, to the use of the poor Inhabitants of the Town, or to bear the common Charges of the Town; yet both Mannors are given to the King. But if the Feoffeés had before the five years conveyed part of the same to another in Feé, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the Land, only that remaining in their hands, and none of the other Land for the Superstitious Vses within the five years, there the King shall not have the Land of the second Feoffeé. And in <hi>Trin.</hi> 18 <hi>Eliz.</hi> The Case was, <hi>A.</hi> seized of Houses in <hi>London,</hi> Devised them, 3 <hi>H.</hi> 6. upon condition, to find an <hi>Obit</hi> of 4 <hi>l.</hi> 6 <hi>s.</hi> 8 <hi>d.</hi> within the Parish of <hi>St. Mary Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> spending thereat so much as the Deviseés would in their discretion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

And it was adjudged, The Quéen should have the Houses; for the appointment was incertain, albeit the imployment was certain. 2. That all the Vse expressed was Superstitious; and therefore it was said, That if Land to the value of 5 <hi>l.</hi> be devised to find an <hi>Obit,</hi> spending upon it 3 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> In this Case, albeit a certain sum is given, yet because the Land is given to that Vse, and no other Vse expressed; it will all go to the King: <hi>Cook</hi> 4 <hi>Par.</hi> 115.</p>

And that the said Confederates, and unknown persons, when they shall be discovered, and their names inserted into this Information, may set forth and discover, where, and in whose hands, and power, the antient Charters and Evidences of, and concerning the said Farme and Premisses, are, and the Dates and Contents thereof, and who hath received the Rents, Issues, and Profits of the same Premisses ever, sithence the determination of the said Demise thereof, for the said Term of 99 years, which did end in the said year of Our Lord God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> aforesaid, and by, and under what Right and Title, and how the same hath since that time beén disposed of, and what Title, Interest, or Estate, they, or any of them have, or claim to have of, into, or out of the said Farm and Premisses, or any of them; and by, from, or under whom, and by what Conveyance. And that the said Confederates may set forth and discover what the true yearly value of the said Farme and Premisses now is, and hath beén, ever since the said year of Our Lord God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And lastly, That the said <hi>Charitable Uses</hi> may be preserved, maintained, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to all succeéding Generations, and may be setled, establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and confirmed, by the Decreé of this Honourable Court.

                     <p>HIs Majesties said Attorney for Replication, saith, and will averre, That all and every the Matters and Things, in, and by his Information in this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Court alledged, are true, in such sort, manner, and form as the same are therein set forth; and that he is, and shall be, at all times ready to prove the same, in such manner as this Honourable Court shall award; and thereupon prayeth Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief in the same, as he hath in, and by his said Information before Prayed. And for further Replication to the Answers of all the said Defendants, and particularly, of the said <hi>W. T.</hi> and <hi>R L.</hi> who acknowledge themselves to be Trusteés of the Farm and Lands in question in this Suit; His Majesties said Attorney saith, That the same Farme and Lands, were wholly given and intended by <hi>R. R.</hi> the Donor thereof, to the <hi>Charitable Uses</hi> in the Information mentioned. And although the said Donor did make, and direct a special distribution of the sum of 6 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s. per ann.</hi> which was the then present Rent thereof; yet that Lease being long since determined, and the said Farm and Lands since increased to the value of 30 <hi>l. per ann.</hi> and now Lett for so much, as by the Answers of the said four Defendants, as well as of the other Defendants doth appear, and it not appearing by the said Defendants Answers, or any of them, that it was the intent of the Donor, that any part of the Rents, Issues, or Profits of the said Farm, or Lands, should be converted by his Trustées, to their own use, or to any other use; or that his Heirs, or that any other person or persons, but such as in the said Information are mentioned, should have any benefit thereof. Therefore His Majesties said Attorney doth averre, that the whole increase and benefit raised, and to be raised by the said Farm and Lands, do since the ending of the Lease thereof in being, at the time of the death of the said Donor, should have béen, and ought to be distributed to the <hi>Charitable Uses</hi> in the said Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, specified, according to such proportions, as in the said In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation is mentioned. And that the said Defendants, <hi>W.T.</hi> and <hi>R. L.</hi> ought to account for, as well such Fine or sum of Money as hath beén raised, or made by them, or any others with them, by letting of any new Lease thereof; as also for the surplusage of the said Rent of the said Premisses, so demi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by them, over and above the said sum of 6 <hi>l.</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> yearly, paid, by them to the <hi>Charitable Use</hi> aforesaid, during the time, they, or any of them, have received the increased Rent
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63482:55"/> of 30<hi>l. per ann.</hi> for which the said Lands have for divers years past, and are now still Demised, and which hath beén yearly paid and answered for the same; and the said whole Rent and Profits of the said Lands received by them, or any of them yearly, ever since the new Letting thereof, after the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the said antient Lease in being, at the time of the death of the said Donor, ought to be all applyed to the <hi>Charitable Use</hi> and <hi>Uses</hi> in the said Information specified in such sort, as is therein set sorth, and to no other use; the said Attorney-General averring, and being ready to prove to this Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Court, that the said Trustées, or any of them, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther persons named, or supposed Trustées with them, did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver in any one year hitherto, since the ending of the said an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient Lease, apply more than 6<hi>l.</hi> 10<hi>s.</hi> thereof, to the said <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Uses,</hi> in the said Information specified, but in the breach of the Trust in them reposed, have, or some of them have mis-imployed, and mis-converted the same overplus-Money, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting in that time, to above 460 <hi>l.</hi> to other uses, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their own wills and pleasures. with this also, That the said Trustées, in further breach of the said Trust, have suffered the House and Buildings, of, and belonging to the said Farm and Lands, to fall into great ruine and decay, for want of timely repairing and amending, either by the Tenant or Tenants thereof, for the time being, or by their, or some of their care, as ought to have béen, and the same House and Build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings are now very ruinous, and in great decay; nor are there sufficient Covenants in the Lease now in being, by them the said Trustées, newly made and granted, to compel the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Tennants or Occupiers of the said Farm-House and Buildings, to repair the same, which is also contrary to the Trust in them reposed, with this also, that it appeareth by the Answers of all the said Defendants, and His Majesties said Attorney, is ready to prove, that the Lands so given, and appointed by the said <hi>R. R.</hi> to the <hi>Charitable Uses</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, do lye dispersedly in the several fields of <hi>V.</hi> in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>H.</hi> and in several parcels in each of the fields in <hi>V.</hi> afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>said, and that the Boundaries of the same, and other mens Lands in the said fields, are so defaced, ploughed up, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded, that the same, and other mens Lands do lye so con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused, and intermingled together, by reason of the defacing and ploughing up of the said Boundaries; That it is very hard and difficult, if not impossible, now to distinguish the same from other mens Lands there, or one mans Lands there from anothers. And therefore the said Attorney-General prayeth, that as well the said Houses and Buildings belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the said Farm, may be speédily repaired; and that the said Trustées, or such of them, as have received by Fine or Rent, the Profits of the said Lands and Premisses, may make and give a true account for the same, and for what hath beén received by them, or any of them; and that the same may be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63482:55"/> applyed to the <hi>Charitable Use</hi> and <hi>Uses</hi> aforesaid. And further, That for the better ascertaining of the Lands belonging to the said Farm, and lying at present so intermixed with the Lands of other Men in <hi>V.</hi> aforesaid, may be forthwith set out by Meéts, and Bounds, whereby the same, for the future, may be certainly known and distinguished from all other mens, there, or otherwise, as in the answers of the said several De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendants, is consented unto; that the like number of Acres, as are belonging to the said Farm, in every of the several fields of <hi>V.</hi> aforesaid, may, without prejudice to any other persons, owner or owners of Lands in the same fields, in each field, be set out, and laid together, and, by consent of all other own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or owners of Lands in the said Fields, be allotted, allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and owned as Lands of and belonging to the said Farm, and to be, in all times hereafter, used and demised with the same; and that if any part of such Lot happen to be the Lands of any other owner or owners of Lands there, such owner or owners may, by their frée consent and consents, accept of such other Lands belonging or supposed to belong to the said Farm, in each of the said fields, as by like consent shall be laid or sett out in lieu thereof; whereunto the said Attorney-General, for and on the behalf of the said Relators, is, and doth hereby declare himself to be willing. And further prayeth, That, to this end, a Commission may be awarded to Gentlemen in the said County, to be approved of by this Honourable Court, for the surveying the same Lands, and setting forth the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar parcels thereof, or laying them; with power also to Treat with all and every owner or owners of Lands in the said Fields of <hi>V.</hi> that may be concerned in the Premisses, and to take and receive their consent and consents, to such proceéd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and setting out of Lands as aforesaid, as shall, or may be made or agréed on by the said Commissioners, or so many of them, as in that behalf, shall be thereunto impowred, and that if néed be, and this Honourable Court shall so think fit, such person and persons, owner and owners of Lands, as shall or may be concerned in the Premisses, and shall give their consents to, or before such Commissioners as aforesaid: and are not already parties to the said Information, may have their names thereunto inserted, and may, by their several An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swers, further testify their several consents to such setting out or laying together of Lands, to belong unto, and be used with the said Farm for the future; and of their accepting of other Lands in lieu thereof, as aforesaid; That this Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Court may procéed to settle the same by consent, finally by the Decreé of this Honourable Court, as to this Honourable Court shall séem most méet. And for the satisfaction of all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons concerned, or to be concerned therein: without this, that any other matter or thing, in any of the Answers of any of the said Defendants, contained material, or effectual in the Law for him the said Attorney-General, to reply unto, and not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

               <p>NO Vse shall be taken by Equity to be a <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable Use</hi> within the meaning of this Statute,<note place="margin">Nota.</note> if it be not within the Letter or Words of the Statute.

                  <note place="margin">Church. Chappel.</note> Chappels may be taken by Equity, and under that word <hi>Church,</hi> all convenient Ornaments,<note place="margin">Finding of Orna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</note> and Concurrents convenient for the decent, and orderly Administration of Divine Service (as for the finding of a Pulpit<note place="margin">Pulpit.</note> or a Sermon-Bell,<note place="margin">Sermon-Bell.</note> &amp;c. may be comprehended. For Reparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of Churches are but preparations for the Administra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Divine Service.</p>
               <p>And as upon the words of the Statute, <hi>5 Ed. 6. cap. 4.</hi> against fighting or striking in Churches, or Churchyards, it hath béen taken, That if any strike another in a Church, Chappel, or Churchyard, he shall be Excommunicate, <hi>ipso facto,</hi> by Equity of the said Statute, upon the word <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Churchyard.</hi> So upon the word <hi>Repair of Churches,</hi> may Chappels be taken by like Equity in this Statute.</p>
               <p>But a Gift of Lands,<note place="margin">A Gift to maintain a Chappel or Minister, to do Divine Service, is not within this Statute.</note> &amp;c. to maintain a Chaplain or Minister, to celebrate Divine Service, is neither with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Letter, nor meaning of this Statute; for it was of
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63482:70"/> purpose omitted in the penning of the Act, lest the Gifts intended to be imployed, upon purposes grounded upon Charity, might, in change of times (contrary to the minds of the Givers) be confiscate into the Kings Treasury. For Religion being variable, according to the pleasure of succéeding Princes, that which at one time is held for Orthodox, may at another, be accounted Superstitious, and then such Lands are confiscate, as appears by the Statute of Chanteryes, <hi>1 E. 6. cap. 14.</hi>

                  <note place="margin">Poor. For relief of Aged, Impotent, and Poor.</note>Vpon these words, <hi>For relief of Aged, Impotent, and Poor People;</hi> Poverty is the principal and essential Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstance to bring the Gift within the compass of this Statute,<note place="margin">Poverty is the Essen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial circumstance.</note> for a Gift to the Aged of such a Parish, or to the Impotent of such a Parish,<note place="margin">Gift to the Aged, without saying Poor, is not within this Act. So to the Impotent, without saying Poor, is not.</note> without expressing their Poverty, is not within the reach of this Act, because they may be rich.</p>
               <p>But a Gift to the Poor without expressing Age or Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potency, is good enough; for poverty, without further re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard, is subject, sufficient for Charity to work upon.</p>
               <p>So a Gift to all the Aged or Impotent of such a Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rish, not assessed in the Subsidy, is good, for those which are not assessed in the Subsidy, are poor within the intent of this Statute.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">Bastard.</note>So a Gift of Money to make a Stock to bind Apprenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Children of such Men as are not in the Subsidy of Goods, to relieve Bastards, is a Charitable Vse, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are like Orphans (having by intendment of Law) no Parents to relieve them.</p>
               <p>
                  <note place="margin">To find Bows and Arrows for Children of poor Men.</note>To find Bows and Arrows for the Children of poor Men, in such a Parish, is good also, because it is an ease to their Fathers, which are poor, and yet are bound to find them.</p>

                  <hi>(Relief)</hi> Vnder this word are comprized, Meat, Drink, and Apparel, wherein threé things are considerable in the Gift, <hi>1.</hi> That it be for necessity only, not for ornament or superfluity. <hi>2.</hi> That it be according to the Laws, not against the Law. <hi>3.</hi> That it be not given to do some act against the Law.</p>
               <p>A Gift to build Houses for the Poor, with four Acres to a Cottage.</p>
               <p>To make Conduits to such Alms-Houses, to maintain a common Landress for the Poor of such Houses. To maintain one to read Prayers to the Poor of such a House.</p>
               <p>To build a House for the Poor to resort unto, to receive their Alms, Pensions, or Payments.</p>

               <p>To increase the Dyet of Alms-men upon Festival days.</p>
               <p>But to make Seats for poor People to beg in by the High-ways, is no Charitable Vse within this Law, for charity must concurr with the Law, and the Law prohibits begging, therefore it is no charity to maintain begging.</p>
               <p>King <hi>Hen. 7.</hi> erected certain Alms-houses at <hi>Westmin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster,</hi> of a certain number of poor people, whereof one should be a Priest, who at certain times was to go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout certain places, and pray for the Souls of the King and his Ancestors. Now although the Gift to the poor might séem Charitable, yet because it would not consist without a Priest to pray for Souls, which is Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, it was decreéd in the <hi>Chancery 27 Junii, ann. 30. R. Jac.</hi> That it was no <hi>Charitable Use</hi> within the Statute. <hi>Simon Peters</hi> Case.</p>
               <p>A Fine was Levied by a Recusant to another in Queén <hi>Elizabeths</hi> time, and this was in Trust, That the Profits might be imployed upon an Hospital of Religious, which should be renewed, when the times would serve; and in the mean time, the Profits to be imployed to the relief of poor people, by the discretion of the Conusee and his Heirs, according to the intent of the Conusor.</p>
               <p>In this Case, because it was apparent, that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor was a Recusant, and the Imployment must be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his intent, and his intent could be to no other then the relief of poor Recusants, which is not agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the Law, therefore Term <hi>Hill. 3.

A Maime is a hurt that disables him for serving any more, as a Soldier or a Mari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
               <p>If the Maim happened in lawful service, the party is relievable, and therefore if in Conductions, or in Camp, a Soldier be maimed by mis-adventure, he is relievable, although he depart from Service without Licence, after the Maim taken, because the Maim was lawful. But if one serve an Enemy, and be there maimed, although he be after pardoned, yet he is not to be relieved by this Law.
